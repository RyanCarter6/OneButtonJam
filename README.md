# OneButtonJam

Code for my second game jam game which was made in under 9 days for 1-Button Jam 2023. 

Didn't get to work on this as much as I would've liked since this jam was during Thanksgiving and I was pretty busy with family stuff, but I still feel like it turned out well. Pretty happy with the quality of the code and comments made, the code was very versatile as I made the whole game with only four scripts.
